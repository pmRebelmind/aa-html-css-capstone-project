                Alpine skiing is the sport of sliding down snow-covered hills on skis with fixed-heel bindings. It is also commonly known as downhill skiing, although that also incorporates different styles. The more traditional is on-piste skiing, where if you can learn to carve, you can get some of thte most exhilarating experiences. At the same time, off-piste skiing on fresh powder is incredible. Can't wait for winter. </p>

            <p>Like with any sport, but especially one as technical as skiing, you need the right equipment. The evolution of ski gear has been phenomenal. Unfortunately, the amount of gear you need to ski is quite outstanding - special shoes, skis, jacket, undergarments. But it can be fun to look for it!</p>

            <h2>Swiss Ski Resorts</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>Switzerland is the alpine country by definition. Almost anywhere you are, if you look around, you will find the alps and their snow-capped peaks year-round. That makes it home to some of the most famous resorts in the world, like Davos-Klosters, Zermatt, or St. Moritz. However, there are many many more, including some hidden jewels that I hope to discover to you today. Pack your gear and come visit!</p>
